        <h1>Hillsborough Community College Early Alert System</h1>
        <img src="assets/HCC.jpg" alt="Studying" "class="center">
      </p> This system is designed to support the success of our students by identifying potential challenges early on and providing timely interventions to ensure their academic progress and well-being. 
        <p> Our Early Alert System leverages the power of Salesforce and Ellucian Colleague to effectively track and manage student alerts.</p>

           <p><h2>
            How It Works
        
           </h2></p>
            
            The Early Alert System utilizes the robust capabilities of our CRM, Salesforce, and integrates with our ERP, Ellucian Colleague, to collect and analyze student data. Through a combination of automated processes and faculty input, the system identifies students who may be facing academic difficulties, attendance issues, or other challenges that may hinder their progress.
            
            <h2>Key Features of Salesforce</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>Automate and manage marketing campaigns</li>
    <li>Offer high-quality customer support</li>
    <li>Salesforce Experiences to create community</li>
    <li>Streamline the student assistance process from alert, to intervention, to follow-up</li>
    <li>Data Analytics</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>Key Features of Ellucian</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>Student information system</li>
    <li>Student support module</li>
    <li>College scheduling software</li>
    <li>Enrollment module</li>
    <li>Data analytics</li>
  </ul>
    <h2>Strategy</h2>

  <p>The key would be to establish an effective communications loop between (1) "front line" offices, (2) students, and (3) the early alert team.</p>
  
  <ol>
    <li>Define program goals: Increasing fall to fall retention rates and college completion rates.</li>
    <li>Identify target populations</li>
    <ul> 
    <li>Allocate resources to at-risk populations for help with: academic preparation, goal development, academic skills, and acculturation to the institution.</li>
    <li>Proactive measures: cross-referencing historical, academic, and demographic data to identify at-risk populations before HCC receives the first red flag. (Data Analytics)</li>
      <li>Reactive measures: Run an ongoing awareness and training campaign to ensure potential referrers, including all faculty and staff, know what to look for and how to respond. Create discussions around common red flags such as absences, tardiness, weak writing skills, missed assignments, early request for transcripts, and mid-term grade performance.
 </ul>
</li>
<li>Build an early alert and intervention team
    <ul>
    <li>Built with representatives from student life, residence life, athletic services, multicultural affairs, disability services, financial aid, enrollment, institutional research, the provost’s office, and the counseling center.
    </ul>
    </li>
  <li>Engage at-risk students
    <ul>
      <li>Use multiple channels</li>
      <li>Offer help: Send the message that stresses (1) someone cares and (2) help is available because the institution wants them to succeed</li>
      <li>Try more than once</li>
      <li>Set a deadline for response</li>
      <li>Personalize</li>
      <li>Make contact info prominent</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>Develop intervention strategies
    <ul>
      <li>Salesforce: Strive to create a single repository for student information, including alert and intervention status and history of communications to date. Educate referrers and responders on the importance of consulting and contributing to this resource.</li>
      <li>Create standard protocols benefits both students and the team. Staff can more effectively handle a heavy influx of alerts. And, they have uniform data for evaluating what works and what doesn’t over time.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>Make early alerts and interventions part of institutional culture (communicate results)
    <ul>
      <li>An ongoing communications campaign should celebrate results, as well as demonstrate accountability to key stakeholders.</li>
      <li>Create simple and user-friendly referrer forms and responder reporting tools to increase likelihood of use.</li>
      <li>Secure an executive champion willing to reinforce the importance of the program in regular communications.</li>
      <li>Advertise program impact on student success on a regular basis.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>Measure and learn (improve over time)
    <ul>
      <b>Sample metrics for monitoring tactics</b>
      <li>Effectiveness of different intervention strategies</li>
      <li>Time elapsed between alert and intervention</li>
      <li>Responder follow-through rate</li>
      <li>Allocation of resources proportional to need (by academic unit, demographic, etc.)</li>
      <b>Sample metrics for monitoring outcomes</b>
      <li>Increase in retention rate among at-risk populations</li>
      <li>Less drop/withdrawal/fail rates in key courses</li>
      <li>Increase in average GPA across terms, years</li>
      <li>Student satisfaction rates</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ol>
